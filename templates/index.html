  Welcome to my Udacity Cloud DevOps Nanodegree Capstone Project!

  In this project, I have had the opportunity to apply the skills and knowledge I've acquired throughout the Nanodegree program.
  I've focused on mastering key technologies and tools such as AWS (Amazon Web Services), CircleCI, Docker, and Kubernetes to create a robust and automated deployment pipeline.
  The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate my proficiency in cloud computing, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), containerization, and orchestration.

  This project serves as a culmination of my learning journey, where I've not only gained practical experience but also honed my problem-solving skills in the realm of DevOps and cloud infrastructure.
